# Intern-PHP-Developper
My main task was to design and develop an application able to manage the financial forecasts. This web application illustrates how the administrator will make decisions based on the results of forecasted revenues and expenses. Added to this, I empowered my knowledge about the architectural pattern MVC, database performances and of course learning soft skills without forgetting how to use web services. The project was developed with: • HTML5, CSS3, bootstrap, javascript (for the frontend) • PHP, (for the backend) • MVC (for the architectual pattern) • Mysql, Qlik Sense(for the Datbase)
